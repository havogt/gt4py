This is a forward-looking analysis of how `gt4py.next` represents *not-yet-known* and
*generic* types, why the current representation feels patched, and what a clean-slate
design would look like. It is intended to inform — not pre-decide — the future generic
work (notably dimension genericity). It deliberately ignores backwards-compatibility so
the target design is stated in its purest form; a pragmatic migration path is sketched at
the end.

## TL;DR

The system uses a single placeholder type (`DeferredType`, and after ADR 0024 the
`name is None` case of `TypeVarType`) to express at least **six different things**. Those
six things are points in a **three-axis space** (binding mode × sort × constraint), and
both the old two-class design and the 0024 merge project that space onto one or two
overloaded classes. The fix is to split the placeholder along its main axis into three
constructs that live in three different places:

- **absence** of a type → `Optional[TypeSpec]` (kept *out* of the type language),
- a **universal parameter** → a kinded `TypeScheme` / `TypeParam` / `ParamRef`,
- a **value-dependent / computed return** → an explicit *type rule* on builtins.

When that is done, both `DeferredType` and the `name is None` discriminator disappear, and
the scan / dimension-genericity hack dissolves with them.

## 1. What is actually being conflated

Tracing every construction and consumption site, the placeholder wears six semantic hats.

| #  | Role | Representative site | What it really is |
|----|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| R1 | Uninitialized `.type` on an AST node before deduction runs | `Expr.type = DeferredType(constraint=None)` default (`ffront/field_operator_ast.py`) | **Absence** of information (⊥); an IR-completeness artifact, not a type |
| R2 | Category-bounded placeholder / expectation | `func_to_past` / `func_to_foast` set `DeferredType(constraint=ProgramType/FunctionType/TupleType)` | A **kind expectation** used for assertions |
| R3 | "Inference gave up / legitimately polymorphic intermediate", tolerated | iterator `inference.py` returns `DeferredType(None)` for undeclared symbols, scan-tuple results, `tuple_get` on deferred | An **unsolved existential** the iterator IR is content to leave unsolved (also absence) |
| R4 | Named, value-constrained dtype generic | `TypeVarType(name, constraints)` | Genuine **universal polymorphism** (∀ over a finite scalar set), monomorphized per call |
| R5 | Dimension genericity for scans | `ffront/type_info.py` rewrites the *entire* program-context signature to `DeferredType(None)` | Faked **∀ over dimensions**: there is no concept, so all structure is erased |
| R6 | Value-dependent builtin return **and** its dispatch trigger | `astype` returns `DeferredType(constraint=(FieldType, ScalarType, TupleType))`; `visit_Call` routes to `_visit_astype` precisely because `not is_concrete(return_type)` | A **type-level function of a value** *plus* an overloaded control-flow signal |

The decisive evidence that R5 is a known hack is in `ffront/type_info.py`, in the function
that builds a scan operator's program-context signature:

```python
# TODO(tehrengruber): What we actually want is a generic type here, but we don't
#  have that concept yet.
as_deferred_type_with_same_structure = type_info.tree_map_type(
    lambda _: ts.DeferredType(constraint=None)
)
```

Every parameter and return of the scan signature is replaced by `DeferredType(None)` —
both the dimensions *and* the dtypes are erased — purely because there is no way to say
"generic in the dimensions".

Two observations:

- **R1, R2, R3 are all "absence"**, dressed up as a type so it can sit in a non-optional
  `.type` field and flow through `isinstance` checks.
- **R4 and R5 are the same phenomenon** (universal parametric polymorphism) at two
  different **sorts** (dtype vs dimensions) — but R4 got a real construct and R5 got
  erasure-to-absence.
- **R6 is a third, unrelated thing** (a computed/dependent return) wedged onto the same
  class and additionally abused as a dispatch flag.

## 2. The three orthogonal axes

Every use above is a point in a 3-axis space; the current design projects it onto one or
two overloaded classes.

- **Axis A — binding mode (the quantifier).** *absent / not-computed* (R1–R3) vs
  *universal parameter* (R4, R5) vs *value-dependent* (R6). In type theory, "a hole to be
  solved" (existential metavariable) and "a parameter to be instantiated" (universal `∀`)
  are **dual** — opposite quantifiers. Conflating them is the original sin. The 0024 merge
  stores both in one class and discriminates with `name is None`; that test *is* the smell
  — a hand-rolled tag distinguishing an existential from a universal.
- **Axis B — sort / kind (what the slot ranges over).** a *dtype*, a *dimension* / *set of
  dimensions*, a *whole type of some category*, a *callable type*. `TypeVarType` is
  dtype-only; `DeferredType.constraint` ranges over "TypeSpec category". Neither can say
  "a dimension".
- **Axis C — constraint.** none / finite value-set (`OneOf`) / category bound (`Bounded`) /
  predicate. The old `constraints` (value-set) and `constraint` (category) are two points
  on this single axis that ended up as two separate fields.

The patchiness is structural: one or two classes spanning a 3-D space means every new
corner needs a new special case.

## 3. Why both the old design and the 0024 merge are patches

- **Old two-class design.** Kept Axis A's *absent* (`DeferredType`) and *universal*
  (`TypeVarType`) as separate classes — good — but (a) gave `DeferredType` a `constraint`
  overlapping conceptually with `TypeVarType.constraints` (Axis C smeared across both), (b)
  made `DeferredType` do R1/R2/R3/R5/R6 at once, and (c) made `TypeVarType` dtype-only so
  R5 had nowhere to go but erasure. Two classes, six jobs.
- **The 0024 merge.** Collapsed Axis A entirely (existential and universal in one class,
  tagged by `name`). Neater plumbing, but it reintroduces the distinction as scattered
  runtime guards (`is_type_var`), permits illegal field combinations (e.g.
  named-without-constraints, `name=None` *with* value constraints), and creates a footgun:
  the natural `isinstance(x, ts.TypeVarType)` now also matches deferred types, and because
  the constraint predicates do `all(... for c in constraints)`, an empty constraint set
  returns *vacuously true*. (This is why the merge had to add `is_type_var` guards at ~8
  sites.)

Neither separates the axes. That is what a clean design must do.

## 4. Proposed clean-slate design

**Core principle: stop modeling "an open type slot" as one thing. Split it along Axis A
into three constructs that live in three different places.**

### Construct 1 — "Not computed yet" is *absence*, kept out of the type language

R1/R2/R3 should not be types at all. An AST node's type becomes `Optional[TypeSpec]` (or,
pragmatically, a single `Unknown` sentinel that is *documented as algorithm-only*, carries
**no** constraint, and is asserted away by the existing completeness validator before any
"final typed IR").

- The category bound (R2) disappears: the deduction pass already knows structurally what
  kind of node it is visiting; a sanity check becomes an `assert`, not a stored value.
- The iterator's "legitimately unknown" (R3) becomes `None` — which is honest: `None`
  cannot be silently `isinstance`-matched as a real type, so the 0024 footgun becomes a
  mypy error rather than a runtime surprise.

Payoff: the type language now contains **only real types and type parameters** — no dummies
flowing around.

### Construct 2 — Polymorphism is a first-class, *kinded* scheme (unifies R4 **and** R5)

Introduce standard `∀`-machinery, kinded so it covers dtype *and* dimension genericity with
one mechanism:

```text
TypeParam   = (name, kind, constraint)            # a bound variable of a scheme
   kind        ∈ { DType, Dims, Type, … }          # Axis B, extensible
   constraint  ∈ { Unconstrained, OneOf{…}, Bounded(category) }   # Axis C, unified

ParamRef(TypeSpec)  = reference to a TypeParam by name   # occurrence inside a body
TypeScheme          = (params: tuple[TypeParam, …], body: TypeSpec)   # type of a generic operator
```

- Dtype-generic field operator:
  `TypeScheme([TypeParam("T", DType, OneOf{f32, f64})], FunctionType(… FieldType(dims=[I, J], dtype=ParamRef("T")) …))`.
- **Dimension-generic scan** (the real fix for R5):
  `TypeScheme([TypeParam("D", Dims, Unconstrained)], FunctionType(… FieldType(dims=ParamRef("D") + [axis], …) …))`.
  The program-context signature is now a proper scheme whose dims-parameter binds from the
  concrete call arguments, instead of erasing all structure to `DeferredType(None)`.
- Monomorphization = `instantiate(scheme, {"T": f32, "D": [I, J]})` — one substitution
  routine over `ParamRef`s, kind-agnostic. This is exactly the generalization ADR 0023 said
  it was deferring ("widening the binding environment to dimensions and generalizing
  same-name rejection across type-parameter kinds").

`ParamRef` (universal, instantiated) is now a **different type from absence** (`None` /
`Unknown`), for a *principled* reason (the quantifier), not the accidental old split. The
`name is None` discriminator vanishes. `is_generic` becomes "contains a `ParamRef` / is a
`TypeScheme`"; `is_concrete` becomes "no `ParamRef`". No "deferred" special-casing.

One honest modeling consequence: making dims genericity real means `FieldType.dims` must
admit a parameter in dimension position (e.g. `list[Dimension] | ParamRef`, or a dims-list
that can contain a "rest" parameter). That is the crux of the work — but it is strictly more
honest than erasing the field's structure to a placeholder, and it is the thing that
actually unblocks generic scans.

### Construct 3 — Value-dependent builtins carry an explicit type rule (R6)

`astype` / `where` / constructors should not encode "compute my return specially" as a
`DeferredType` return that `visit_Call` sniffs via `not is_concrete`. A polymorphic builtin
should carry an explicit **type rule** — a function from argument types to result type —
that deduction invokes directly. This removes both halves of R6: the return is computed by
the rule (no placeholder), and dispatch is driven by *which builtin it is* (no
`is_concrete`-as-flag overload). It also makes the builtin's polymorphism inspectable rather
than implicit.

### How the six roles land

- R1, R2, R3 → **absence** (`Optional` / `Unknown`), out of the type language.
- R4, R5 → **`TypeScheme` + kinded `TypeParam` / `ParamRef`**, one mechanism, dtype *and* dims.
- R6 → **explicit type rule on builtins**, computed returns.

The type language ends up with a sharp three-way separation that maps exactly onto Axis A:
*real types*, *universal parameters* (`ParamRef`, bound by a `TypeScheme`), and *the absence
of a type*. Illegal states (named-without-constraints, deferred-with-value-constraints, a
dtype type-variable used in a dimension position) become unrepresentable rather than
validator-policed.

## 5. Honest trade-offs

- **Not behavior-preserving, and bigger than the 0024 merge.** It touches the IR (`.type`
  becomes optional), the deduction passes, monomorphization (now kinded), and introduces
  scheme/param/ref plus a small kind enum. The `Optional[.type]` migration is the invasive
  part (every `.type` access must handle `None`); it is the price of making "absence"
  honest, and it can be staged behind a temporary `Unknown` sentinel.
- **Kinds add ceremony.** For a system that *today* only ships dtype generics, "kinded
  parameters" looks like over-engineering — but the named next step *is* dimension
  genericity, so it is precisely the investment that pays off, and it can start with just
  `{DType, Dims}`.
- **Schemes add an indirection** (operator types become `TypeScheme(params, body)` rather
  than a bare `FunctionType`), rippling into anything that inspects operator signatures.
  That is real churn, but it makes "this operator is generic in X" a first-class, queryable
  fact instead of something inferred by scanning for placeholders.

## 6. Pragmatic migration path

The clean design is not fresh-start in practice; it can be reached incrementally, and the
0024 merge becomes a stepping stone rather than a dead end. Each step stands on its own and
removes one of the six hats:

1. **Introduce `TypeScheme` + kinded `TypeParam`** and migrate the existing dtype
   `TypeVarType` to a `DType`-kinded parameter bound by a scheme. (The current work is most
   of the way here already.)
2. **Add the `Dims` kind and delete the scan program-context erasure (R5).** Highest-value
   cleanup: it removes a known hack and proves the kind system on a second sort.
3. **Replace builtin deferred-returns with explicit type rules (R6).**
4. **Migrate `.type` to optional / `Unknown` and delete `DeferredType` entirely (R1–R3).**
   Most invasive, done last.

One-line summary: the system is trying to express *absence*, *a universal parameter*, and
*a computed return* with a single placeholder type. Give each its own home — absence as
`Optional`, parameters as a kinded `TypeScheme`, computed returns as type rules — and both
`DeferredType` and the `name is None` discriminator disappear, taking the scan / dimension
hack with them.
